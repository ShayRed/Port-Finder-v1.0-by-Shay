## ⚠️ Antivirus Notice

Some antivirus programs may report a false positive. This is due to the way the program is compiled into an EXE file. 
The tool is completely safe and is designed specifically for:

- Game server monitoring
- Network connection analysis
- Process performance tracking

If you receive a warning:
1. Add the folder to your antivirus exceptions
2. Use the "Run anyway" option

This is a common occurrence with network monitoring tools as they require system access to analyze connections and processes.

## 🔒 Security

- No data collection or transmission
- Purely local analysis
- Only monitors specified game processes
- No system modifications

## 🛡️ Technical Safety Details

The tool only performs:
- Port scanning of specified ranges
- Memory reading of selected processes
- Network traffic monitoring
- System resource analysis

All operations are:
- Visible in real-time through the interface

- Locally executed
- Non-invasive monitoring only
